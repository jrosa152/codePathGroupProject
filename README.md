## Overview
### Description
Workout Planner is an app to simplify planning your workouts. With the workout planner, you can simply pick a body part and see a log of workouts which you can select from to add to your own personal log.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health/Fitness
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for mobile but has the potential to translate onto a web application. Most functionality would be on mobile, as most people view their workout plans on the go.
- **Story:** Tracks/logs a user's selected workouts into a personal list. User can delete from their log or add to it.
- **Market:** This app can be used by anyone of any age.
- **Habit:** Since this is a personal list, the user can use it as often as they would like.
- **Scope:** First we want to develop a personal list of workouts that can be chosen from a log of hard coded workouts. On a larger scale, we can create a weekly schedule/planner where a user can plan out their weekly workouts, and create their own workouts instead of having to choose from a list.
